					<h2>Discovery of the Cell.</h2>
					<h3 class="rh">
					Cells were first discovered by<strong>"Robert Hooke"</strong> in 1665. He observed the cells in a cork slice with the help of a primitive microscope .Hooke observed that the cells in the cork were actually dead cells.

						1.Robert Hooke was a multi talented scientist.He is still remembered as architect,physicist,geologist,etc..and is also known for his contribution in biology. <br>
						2.Robert Hooke most important work in biology is <i>"Micrographia"</i>(book) which later inspired discoverers like <em>Leeuwenhoek</em>

						<strong><em>"Anton van Leeuwenhoe"</em></strong> a Dutch merchant without university studies, who discovered microscopic life at the end of the 17th century. Leeuwenhoek was the first person to see unicellular animals, bacteria, red blood cells and sperm, and all with his homemade microscopes and an insatiable curiosity as his only instruments.

				<h2>Explanation:</h2>
				<div class="Expp">
					<p>
						1.Anton van Leeuwenhoe was the first person, who to see tiny living organisms in a drop of water. In 1674 Van Leeuwenhoek carefully observed the living things in pond water and made detailed drawings of each kind of organism. He called these organisms animalcules.Today it is known as micro-organisms .<br><br>
						2.He is known as "the father of microbiology".<br><br>
						3.Leeuwenhoek succeeded in making some of the most important discoveries in the history of biology. It was he who discovered bacteria, free-living and parasitic microscopic protists, sperm cells, blood cells, microscopic nematodes and rotifers, and much more. His researches, which were widely circulated, opened up an entire world of microscopic life to the awareness of scientists.
